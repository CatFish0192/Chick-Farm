## remark

Database encryption with pysqlcipher in 2.9Beta7. If it says: "pip install pysqlcipher" cannot be installed, use the "pip install pysqlcipher3-1.2.1-py38-none-win_amd64.whl" command to install (only Python 3.8 is available!).

For MacOS, we haven't tested it yet(theoretically working with our approach)

All methods of running Chick Manor with Python require python version 3.6 or higher and the colorama dependency libraries(v2.2 or above), we recommend python 3.8 or higher
